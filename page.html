    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutral with Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive SPA with two main views, accessible via tabs: "Dashboard" and "Project Deep Dive". This structure was chosen to serve two user needs: 1) a high-level strategic overview (Dashboard) and 2) a detailed exploration of individual projects (Deep Dive). The Dashboard uses charts to summarize the strategic focus and stakeholder value across all 8 projects. The Deep Dive view allows the user to select any project from a dropdown, which then dynamically renders its details (including a unique radar chart for its value proposition) and organizes its complex text into "How it Works," "Value," and "Challenges" tabs. This interactive, non-linear structure is superior to the report's linear list, as it allows stakeholders to quickly filter by strategic goal or explore projects based on their interests. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - App Navigation: Goal: Organize. Method: HTML/JS Tabs. Interaction: Click to show/hide main content panes. Justification: Standard SPA navigation, cleanly separates overview from detail. (No SVG/Mermaid).
        - Dashboard - Project Focus: Goal: Compare. Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Best way to show counts of projects against categorical data (pillars). (No SVG/Mermaid).
        - Dashboard - Stakeholder Value: Goal: Compare (Proportions). Method: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Clearly shows the proportional focus of value propositions for the entire portfolio. (No SVG/Mermaid).
        - Deep Dive - Project Selector: Goal: Navigate. Method: HTML <select> dropdown. Interaction: Onchange event. Justification: A simple, space-efficient way to navigate 8 distinct items. (No SVG/Mermaid).
        - Deep Dive - Value Scorecard: Goal: Compare (Profile). Method: Radar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Dynamically updates on dropdown change. Justification: Perfectly visualizes the multi-dimensional "profile" of a single project's value prop. (No SVG/Mermaid).
        - Deep Dive - Project Details: Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: HTML/JS Tabs. Interaction: Click to show/hide text blocks. Justification: Manages dense textual content for each project, making it digestible. (No SVG/Mermaid).
